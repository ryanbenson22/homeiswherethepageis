    <p>This is a combined journal entry because I have thoughts. These readings came to me at a time where I am really questioning my relationship with social media. I have already deleted Snapchat and TikTok, and now debating deleting Twitter and Instagram, my two most used apps. I can feel myself stepping away from social media, despite my love of posting and seeing what others are doing. This, however, has stopped me from figuring out what people are doing by talking to them. Social media and that damn iPhone are what I mostly think about when I think of technology. I forget that almost all inventions are technology. My espresso machine is technology. The books I read are about technology. My face wash is technology. It makes me appreciate technology, but not love the current state of technology.

            The second reading made me think a lot about what my life would be like after social media. What would I post on? I enjoy Tumblr and love Substack, but is that all I would post on? Is that okay? Perhaps my website is a form of image sharing. My website is a digital scrapbook. My website is a photo junkyard. My website is for sharing images and words. Instagram without Mark Zuckerberg. </p>
